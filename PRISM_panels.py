"""Classes of MAXIS Panels"""
"""This script defines classes for all of the panels in MAXIS
Each of the panels will have a gather_data method used to get all of the information listed on the panel.
Calling class_name.gather_data() will create class properties for each of the data elements.
Many of the STAT panels will also have a create_new method to create a new panel."""
